       <p><strong class="names">Emerald Woodin:</strong>
        "My family and I love this diner!!! Such yummy food and very kid friendly as well for our 2 year old daughter!!! Thanks for serving us"
         </p>
       <p><strong>Nathan Mailly:</strong>
        "Great food and awesome prices!"
       </p>
       <p><strong class="names">Ashley C:</strong> "We eat breakfast here a few times a month. Its always delicious and fast. Dr.Mike is very nice and always there. If you'd like to learn more about the area just sit beside him and he'll gladly tell you."

        <p><strong class="names">Robdenzach:</strong>"Came to Sabattus to play disc golf and looked on here for some local restaurants and saw this place had good reviews so I figured I would give it a try. When we walked in we were greeted by a very pleasant woman and saw a nice couple eating Shepard pie and my son was immediately excited. He ordered that while I ordered the American chop suey and the hubby got the haddock fish sandwich,everything was yummy. My only complaint would be that we didn't get to come back for breakfast as I am sure it would have been excellent."

        <p><strong class="names">Newenglandgrl27:</strong> "We moved here in September and have been sampling the local haunts. We have been to the good doctor's place about half a dozen times. The home made bread, eggs over easy, omelettes, home fries, pan cakes are all excellent. By the way if you order the pancakes go for a single. I got a stack and they are huge and much too filling to finish! The servers are all very nice. The decor is like a 50's diner and the restrooms were spotless. The week before Christmas Santa stopped by the diner and gave the children seated in a booth behind us a small gift. There are always regulars at the counter which is a good sign. The coffee was decent and the refills with a smile kept coming until we asked our server to stop. I would definitely recommend you dine here! "

        <p><strong class="names">BeeMelissa:</strong> "We actually went to Lisbon Falls to try the Sausage Kitchen (from their ad on tv)...after visiting there, we went to Dr. Mike's Madness Cafe for lunch/dinner. What a pleasant surprise! First of all, the waiter was so friendly...I ordered that day's special with a little trepidation (as it was not an Italian restaurant)...chicken cacciatore over pasta, salad, and garlic bread...It was truly delicious...lots of fresh chicken and lots of fresh mushrooms and peppers The garlic bread was soggy and not very toasted, but hey...I didn't need that any way. My husband had the traditional burger and fries and loved it! Unlimited fresh iced tea for me and I was happy...it was in between lunch and dinner and there were only a few customers, but they all knew each other and even inlcuded us in their conversation! We could sense the smell of fresh baked cookies and decided when they came out of the oven to share one...well, it was huge (size of a saucer) and scrumptious, so glad our timing was perfect! On our second visit to Lisbon Falls, we tried a different restaurant for lunch and were sorry we did...We should have gone to Dr. Mike's Madness Cafe again! "

        <p><strong class="names">Bretahna:</strong> "I enjoy the food at Dr mikes madness frequently as does a lot of the town of Lisbon falls. The prices are fairly cheap for today's economy and the portions are big! Their breakfast is their strong point for sure with homemade breads, amazing omelets and some of the best grilled homefries. Their lunch and dinner menu has a great selection from the usual chicken fingers and subs to melt in your mouth brisket or a heaping plate of boiled dinner. Burgers are a favorite of a lot of regulars with literally any toppings you could think of. There's the kitchen sink with bacon, meat sauce, grilled peppers n onions and melted cheese. One Burger they are known for is the belly buster made of 1lb of meat,6oz of French fries on top covered with 1/4lb of cheese and coleslaw all on one bun! Haha crazy I know.. but true. The atmosphere is pretty neat with flashy purple booths and the old diner feel. The owner Dr Mike is almost always sitting at the closest spot to the door greeting people as they come in. There are a lot of regulars and the crew that's working there now is one of the strongest ones I've seen that restaurant have in the past 2 years. Its a very friendly place for the town to enjoy."

        <p><strong class="names">Dinerms: </strong>"We met Mike on our Maine diner road trip. He was super with information and makes the claim that his caf√© is Al's Diner from 11 22 63. If you have to ask, never mind. We just stopped in for a Moxie and were treated by a great conversation with Mike, a sweet waitress. Melinda, a some nice wishes from a few locals. Would love to be able to make this a daily stop!"
