Take a look at the randomly displayed content demo

Take a look at randomly rotating content demo
Let’s Get Started

So first the markup. I placed all of the "did you know" tips into one unordered list:

The idea is to HIDE all of the tips and then display randomly chosen one using JavaScript.

So to style and hide the tips we use the following CSS code:

#tips, #tips li{
  margin:0;
  padding:0;
  list-style:none;
  }
#tips{
  width:250px;
  font-size:16px;
  line-height:120%;
  }
#tips li{
  padding:20px;
  background:#e1e1e1;
  display:none; /* hide the items at first only */
  }

The downside to this solution is that initially all of the tips are hidden, so users with disabled JavaScript and enabled CSS will not be able to see them at all while users with disabled JS/CSS (as well as search engines) will see all of them.

To display one of them randomly we will use small jQuery script. Of course you will have to download jQuery put it somewhere on your server and link to it by placing this code inside the head tag of your document (link to your jQuery.js file).



this.

Short one isn’t it. Take a look at the demo (refresh the page couple of times) to see how it works.
Taking it One Step Further

If this simple functionality doesn’t satisfy you, here’s more. With modifying the above code a bit we can get fade in/out tips that rotate randomly. Of course the code doesn’t allow same tip to display twice in a row.
Note that you are able to modify length of the pause between random rotations.
    
Take a look at this demo to see it in action.

    About the automatic rotating content, there's always a flash of white background when it rotates. It's easily fixed: apply background:#e1e1e1; to #tips too. That should fix it, the background doesn't flash anymore! And about the accessibility issue: Remove display: none; from the CSS and modify the Javascript to this: $(document).ready(function(){ $("#tips li").hide(); randomtip(); }); And tataa, every user sees the list: CSS, no JS; No CSS, JS; Both; None. Nice script ;)

    @Pieter: if you use $("#tips li").hide(); in JS you will have all of the tips displayed before page loads and then when the page-load is done the script will hide all tips and show one. I wanted to avoid that to be honest.

    This can be very useful. Thanks!

    I'm curious, why are you doing: this.randomtip = function(){ In particular, why are you using "this" and not var - or better yet, wrapping it up in a singleton/module pattern?

    Cool code, works as it should!! After a couple hours of playing with code, this is a great find. I set the width in the CSS, and it is displaying wide. Ideas on how to get the width to adhere to 215? Currently it seems to be showing at about 400px wide...... page is at http://www.satoridigitalmarketing.com/clients/traverslasik/template.html Vicky

    @Vicky: the css for this script is pretty basic and straightforward. What you should look out for is inherited css as well as extra elements (I noticed an empty <p> in your source code).

    Thanks. I'll dig it out. The CSS for this durn site (I'm doing a re-write from someone elses code) is a labyrinth, spread across several files. I need a ball of string to leave myself a path to find my way back out, LOL.

    @cssglobe: I've adopted your script into a client's website. The tips are near the bottom of the page. However when you scroll to very bottom, it jumps up a bit when the tip changes. I'll scroll down again, and it jumps up with the next tip. Any ideas?

    Nevermind on that. Wrapped it in a div and problem solved.

    I liked it a lot. I'm designing our church's website and I came accross a little problem. I've tried to use both scripts in the page, one for a rotating news and the other for a random bible verse. But they don't work together. Would you help me with that? Thanks
